## About

Chart manager is a program that helps you create and edit any charts for Muse Dash. It's still in development, so if you have found any bugs then let me know.

## Making charts

Before making charts you need to select a chart folder:

### Creating

Fill these fields for your chart and select files for it:

Cover, demo and music files are __required__. Cover is .png/.gif, demo and music are .mp3/.ogg. Video for cinema supports .mp4

After you filled up all fields simply click "Generate chart files". Chart files should've been generated in selected folder

### Editing

To edit a chart you will need the top menu of the program. To offset music/demo click one of the buttons.
If you haven't selected a program for offsetting, it will prompt you to do it. 
Navigate to the program and select .exe file(*for example Audacity.exe*)

You can also edit BMS maps of your chart. Click "Edit BMS" and choose a map to edit.
Just like for the offset, you will need to select a program for editing BMS maps.
Most of us use MDBMSC, so just select it.

Additionally you can open info.json file and edit it.
