## About

Chart manager is a program that helps you create and edit custom charts for Muse Dash. It's still in development, so let me know if you find any bugs.

## Making charts

Before making charts you need to select a chart folder:

### Creating

Fill these fields for your chart and select files for it:

Cover, demo and music files are __required__. Cover is .png/.gif, demo and music are .mp3/.ogg. Cinema video supports .mp4

After you fillupa the fields simply click "Generate chart files". Chart files will be generated in the selected folder

### Editing

Even though it's not necessary, you can edit a chart using the top menu of the program.

To offset music/demo click "Offset" and select demo or music.
If you haven't selected a program for offsetting, it will prompt you to do it. 
Navigate to the program and select .exe file(*for example Audacity.exe*)

You can also edit BMS maps of your chart. Click "Edit BMS" and choose a map to edit.
Just like for the offset you will need to select a program for editing BMS maps.
Most of us use MDBMSC, so just select it.
(If you want to change path for offset or bms editor programs you can do it by clicking on "Select Programs")

In the "Open" tab you can open some files of your chart or open the entire folder.

MDMC menu contains some links.

If you need some help with charting you can find some [docs](https://github.com/taypexx/chart_manager/tree/main/assets) in the Help tab.

## Saving

After you are done with your chart you can either pack it into MDM file
(it will be saved in chart folder) or do the same but save it to the Muse Dash 
Custom_Albums folder.
If you haven't packed the chart yet and you want to save it to custom albums folder
the program will ask you to do it.

## Custom Background

If you want to change the background image of the program you can replace [bg.png](https://github.com/taypexx/chart_manager/blob/main/assets/bg.png)
with your own image. Also works for other images and icon files.
